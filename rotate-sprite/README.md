# Experiment 1 - Sprite Rotation

Old games used a technique to animate sprites where they shifted the sprint one
row or column per frame. An easy/cheesy way to do this is to just produce a set
of sprites that are shifted already and treat them as individual frames.

I want to see if there's a way to do it without duplicating and modifying the
sprite. I'm thinking that ancient platforms (think Commodore C=64 or Apple ][)
wouldn't have the memory to waste for this sort of thing.

The goal is to do this with one draw call, rather than two. I haven't thought
of a way to make this work without doubling the width (or height) of the
sprite, depending on which way you want to rotate.
