# Experiment 1 - Sprite Rotation

Old games used a technique to animate sprites where they shifted the sprint one
row or column per frame. An easy/cheesy way to do this is to just produce a set
of sprites that are shifted already and treat them as individual frames.

I want to see if there's a way to do it without duplicating and modifying the
sprite. I'm thinking that ancient platforms (think Commodore C=64 or Apple ][)
wouldn't have the memory to waste for this sort of thing.
