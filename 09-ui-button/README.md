# Experiment 9 - UI Button

In this experiment, we'll draw a button with some text in it. It'll respond
to the mouse hovering over it, and clicks.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
./love .
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Launch Löve2D". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.
