# Experiment 16 - Joystick

This experiment grabs data from a joystick and prints it on-screen.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
./love .
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Launch Löve2D". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

This is written in Lua, using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 2D game engine. I
didn't know about that until I stumbled on [CS50's Introduction to Game
Development](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-game-development).
