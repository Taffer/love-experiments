# LÖVE Experiments

Some experiments using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game framework and Lua.

I'm very slowly working on a couple of projects using LÖVE, but I also need
to figure out how to do stuff. I'm dumping it all in here in case it's useful
for someone else to learn from it.

The experiments:

## Bribe me

Want to bribe me to work on more experiments, faster? Want to suggest an
experiment?

Always willing to entertain suggestions, but if you're asking me to do some
work, you have the option of fuelling it with coffee. ;-)
