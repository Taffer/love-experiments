# LÖVE Experiments

Some experiments using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game framework and Lua.

I'm very slowly working on a couple of projects using LÖVE, but I also need
to figure out how to do stuff. I'm dumping it all in here in case it's useful
for someone else to learn from it.

## Credits

This is written in Lua, using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 2D game engine. I
didn't know about that until I stumbled on [CS50's Introduction to Game
Development](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-game-development).

## License

Check the `.lua` file headers for individual credits for third-party goodies;
stuff I wrote is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md). I'm only using
open source third-party bits, but they might not be using MIT's license.
